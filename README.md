# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Project with Vite

This is a basic React project set up using Vite.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/document-slect.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd document-select
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to see the application.

## Build

To build the production-ready code, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the optimized production build.
